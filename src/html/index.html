                >The logic of cybernetics, applied to the history of the
                universe, is in the process of demonstrating how the galaxies,
                the solar system, the Earth, cellidar life could not help but be
                born. According to cybernetics, the universe is formed by a
                series of feedbacks, positive and negative, at first through the
                force of gravity that concentrates masses of hydrogen in the
                primitive cloud, then through nuclear force and centrifugal
                force which are balanced with the first. From the moment that
                the process is set in motion, it can only follow the logic of
                this chain.

              Yes, but at the beginning nobody knew it, — Qfwfq explained, — I
              mean, you could foretell it perhaps, but instinctively, by ear,
              guessing. I don't want to boast, but from the start I was willing
              to bet that there was going to be a universe, and I hit the nail
              on the head; on the question of its nature, too, I won plenty of
              bets, with old Dean (k)yK.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we started betting there wasn't anything yet that might lead
              you to foresee anything, except for a few particles spinning
              around, some electrons scattered here and there at random, and
              protons all more or less on their own. I started feeling a bit
              strange, as if there was going to be a change of weather (in fact,
              it had grown slightly cold), and so I said: "You want to bet we're
              heading for atoms today?"
            </p>
            <p>
              And Dean (k)yK said: "Oh, cut it out. Atoms! Nothing of the sort,
              and I'll bet anything you say."
            </p>
            <p>So I said: "Would you even bet ix?"</p>
            <p>The Dean answered: "Ix raised to en!"</p>
            <p>
              He had no sooner finished saying this than around each proton its
              electron started whirling and buzzing. An enormous hydrogen cloud
              was condensing in space. "You see? Full of atoms!"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Oh, if you call that stuff atoms!" (k)yK said; he had the bad
              habit of putting up an argument, instead of admitting he had lost
              a bet.
