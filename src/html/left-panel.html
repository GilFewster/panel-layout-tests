                At one time, according to Sir George H. Darwin, the Moon was
                very close to the Earth. Then the tides gradually pushed her far
                away: the tides that the Moon herself causes in the Earth's
                waters, where the Earth slowly loses energy.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              How well I know! — old Qf^fq cried,— the rest of you can't
              remember, but I can. We had her on top of us all the time, that
              enormous Moon: when she was full — nights as bright as day, but
              with a butter-colored light — it looked as if she were going to
              crush us; when she was new, she rolled around the sky like a black
              umbrella blown by the wind; and when she was waxing, she came
              forward with her horns so low she seemed about to stick into the
              peak of a promontory and get caught there. But the whole business
              of the Moon's phases worked in a different way then: because the
              distances from the Sun were different, and the orbits, and the
              angle of something or other, I forget what; as for eclipses, with
              Earth and Moon stuck together the way they were, why, we had
              eclipses every minute: naturally, those two big monsters managed
              to put each other in the shade constantly, first one, then the
              other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Orbit? Oh, elliptical, of course: for a while it would huddle
              against us and then it would take flight for a while. The tides,
              when the Moon swung closer, rose so high nobody could hold them
              back. There were nights when the Moon was full and very, very low,
              and the tide was so high that the Moon missed a ducking in the sea
              by a hair’s- breadth; well, let' s say a few yards anyway. Climb
              up on the Moon? Of course we did. All you had to do was row out to
              it in a boat and, when you were underneath, prop a ladder against
              her and scramble up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The spot where the Moon was lowest, as she went by, was off the
              Zinc Cliffs. We used to go out with those little rowboats they had
              in those days, round and flat, made of cork. They held quite a few
              of us: me, Captain Vhd Vhd, his wife, my deaf cousin, and
              sometimes little Xlthlx — she was twelve or so at that time. On
              those nights the water was very calm, so silvery it looked like
              mercury, and the fish in it, violet-colored, unable to resist the
              Moon's attraction, rose to the surface, all of them, and so did
              the octopuses and the saffron medusas. There was always a flight
              of tiny creatures — little crabs, squid, and even some weeds,
              light and filmy, and coral plants — that broke from the sea and
              ended up on the Moon, hanging down from that lime-white ceiling,
              or else they stayed in midair, a phosphorescent swarm we had to
              drive off, waving banana leaves at them.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is how we did the job: in the boat we had a ladder: one of us
              held it, another climbed to the top, and a third, at the oars,
              rowed until we were right under the Moon; that's why there had to
              be so many of us (I only mentioned the main ones). The man at the
              top of the ladder, as the boat approached the Moon, would become
              scared and start shouting: "Stop! Stop! I'm going to bang my
              head!" That was the impression you had, seeing her on top of you,
              immense, and all rough with sharp spikes and jagged, saw-tooth
              edges. It may be different now, but then the Moon, or rather the
              bottom, the underbelly of the Moon, the part that passed closest
              to the Earth and almost scraped it, was covered with a crust of
              sharp scales. It had come to resemble the belly of a fish, and the
              smell too, as I recall, if not downright fishy, was faintly
              similar, like smoked salmon.

                >The logic of cybernetics, applied to the history of the
                universe, is in the process of demonstrating how the galaxies,
                the solar system, the Earth, cellidar life could not help but be
                born. According to cybernetics, the universe is formed by a
                series of feedbacks, positive and negative, at first through the
                force of gravity that concentrates masses of hydrogen in the
                primitive cloud, then through nuclear force and centrifugal
                force which are balanced with the first. From the moment that
                the process is set in motion, it can only follow the logic of
                this chain.

              Yes, but at the beginning nobody knew it, — Qfwfq explained, — I
              mean, you could foretell it perhaps, but instinctively, by ear,
              guessing. I don't want to boast, but from the start I was willing
              to bet that there was going to be a universe, and I hit the nail
              on the head; on the question of its nature, too, I won plenty of
              bets, with old Dean (k)yK.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we started betting there wasn't anything yet that might lead
              you to foresee anything, except for a few particles spinning
              around, some electrons scattered here and there at random, and
              protons all more or less on their own. I started feeling a bit
              strange, as if there was going to be a change of weather (in fact,
              it had grown slightly cold), and so I said: "You want to bet we're
              heading for atoms today?"
            </p>
            <p>
              And Dean (k)yK said: "Oh, cut it out. Atoms! Nothing of the sort,
              and I'll bet anything you say."
            </p>
            <p>So I said: "Would you even bet ix?"</p>
            <p>The Dean answered: "Ix raised to en!"</p>
            <p>
              He had no sooner finished saying this than around each proton its
              electron started whirling and buzzing. An enormous hydrogen cloud
              was condensing in space. "You see? Full of atoms!"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Oh, if you call that stuff atoms!" (k)yK said; he had the bad
              habit of putting up an argument, instead of admitting he had lost
              a bet.
